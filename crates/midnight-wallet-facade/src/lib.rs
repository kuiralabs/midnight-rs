//! The API a consumer programs a Midnight wallet against.
//!
//! [`WalletFacade`] names the role. Every reading returns an owned value and
//! every mutation is one call, so nothing a caller holds is a lock and no
//! implementation is committed to a particular way of sharing its state. This
//! crate carries the trait alone and speaks in `midnight-types`'s
//! vocabulary, so it depends on no wallet implementation; `midnight-wallet`
//! implements it with `LocalWallet`, over a `Wallet` that process owns.
//!
//! Serializing the sync methods against each other is the caller's job.
//! [`WalletFacade::resync`], [`WalletFacade::rescan_shielded`],
//! [`WalletFacade::watch_for_coins`] and [`WalletFacade::forget_coins`] each
//! release the wallet between what they read and what they commit, so two that
//! interleave can lose one's work. `MidnightProvider` holds a mutex across
//! them.
